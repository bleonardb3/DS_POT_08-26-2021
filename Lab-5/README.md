# Lab-5: Machine Learning using SparkML

## Introduction:
In this lab, you will use SparkML in Watson Studio to run generated travel data through a machine learning algorithm, automatically tune the algorithm, and save the model into the project repository. 

## Objectives:
Upon completing the lab, you will know how to:

1. Create a projec token.
1. Identify labels and transform data.
1. Conduct feature engineering for algorithm data.
1. Declare a machine learning model.
1. Setup the Pipeline for data transforms and training.
1. Train the data.
1. Show and evaluate machine learning results.
1. Automatically tune machine learning results.
1. Save the model to the model repository
